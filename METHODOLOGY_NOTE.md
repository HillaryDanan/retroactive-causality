# Methodology Clarification

## Dataset Differences
- **Original (N=30)**: Measured specific target words only (e.g., "horse", "man")
- **Expanded (N=655)**: Measured all tokens across all layers

This explains the mean difference (0.0305 vs 0.1091). Both show significant effects.

## Statistical Transparency
- Causality test: **Significant** (100% reduction)
- Semantic validity: Not significant (p=0.827)
- Ambiguity types: Differences not significant (p=0.2429)

We report all findings transparently, including null results.
